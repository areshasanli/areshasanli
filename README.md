### 👷 Experience

I'm a Data Engineer at [**HAL-X**](https://hal-x.com), an AI ecosystem company. Here's my [resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/umudhasanli/).

I work on the data layer that powers AI products — building pipelines, preparing datasets, and making sure models get clean, validated, structured inputs. Most of my day-to-day involves construction cost data (Hal-Cost, IFC), dataset research, data quality, and turning messy real-world data into something production ML systems can actually use.

### 🔧 Open Source

Distributed scraper that built a [850+ hour Azerbaijani audio news dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mergenAI/oxu.az) for ASR/TTS training. Redis-backed job queue with 64 parallel workers, deduplication, and NVIDIA NeMo manifest output. Used in production for speech model training.

[**electroscrape-hub**](https://github.com/areshasanli/electroscrape-hub)

Production-grade multi-site product scraping system with round-robin scheduling, anti-blocking, and a centralized catalog that normalizes product data across 30+ sources into a unified schema. FastAPI + Celery + PostgreSQL.
