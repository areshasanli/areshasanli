## Hi, I'm Umud

I am a Data Engineer working on data preparation, data pipelines, and database systems for AI.
Involved in data research, data quality improvement, and preparing reliable datasets for analytical and AI use. I work with structured, semi-structured, and raw datasets in formats such as Parquet, JSON, CSV, and SQL-based tables, including supervised and unsupervised data, operational, analytical, and research-oriented datasets across different stages of data pipelines. I independently conduct data research, process raw data, and build well-structured datasets designed for AI use.
